						<h3> Amplifying A Personal Brand: A Case Study on Tony Weaver Jr.'s Instagram Follower Growth</h3>
						<p>More followers, More opportunities</p>
							<h4>Introduction</h4>
							<p></p>
							Tony Weaver Jr., an anime influencer, and CEO of Weird Enough Productions, sought to expand his impact and reach a broader audience through his Instagram account. As the Communications Manager responsible for his social media strategy, I embarked on a campaign to enhance his Instagram presence and attract a more diverse and engaged follower base.
							To do so, I took an analytics-based approach.

							<header class="major">
								<h4>Audience Analysis</h4>
								Understanding the target audience was crucial to this strategy. I conducted in-depth research to identify the demographics, interests, and values of Tony's existing followers and the audience he aimed to reach. It was clear that his actual audience and perceived audience were not the same, but it offered an interesting prospect. Instead of seeking to completely cater to a younger audience in line with the work the educational component of Weird Enough is responsible for, we would work to create content that fit the existing older audience, while establishing a wholesome, positive, and most importantly, safe space for a younger audience. 
								<span class="image right"><img src="images/Data/IG age.PNG" alt="" /></span>As seen by the graph, Tony’s Instagram audience is overwhelmingly over the age of 18 and currently, as the time of this publication, it remains this way. However, due to changes in content strategy which will be explained in more detail later, a significant portion of our viewership has shared our videos with younger individuals in their circles, fostering connections that, in turn, have sparked the interest of a younger demographic in Weird Enough's flagship webtoon, The UnCommons.

							<h4>Content Strategy</h4>
							<p></p>
							Tony and I worked closely to develop a new strategy that would be conducive to growth. In that strategy, it was decided to highlight Tony’s unique perspective on Anime and Anime/Manga culture, his engaging personality and his love of education aligning with his mission to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion.

						<header>
							<header class="major">
							<h4>Diverse Content Formats</h4>
							<p></p>
							We diversified content formats, incorporating carousel posts, video content, stories, and live streams to keep the feed engaging and varied.
						</header>
					
							<header class="major">
							<h4>Engagement Strategy</h4>
							<p></p>
							Engagement was the top priority as high engagement would indicate content the audience responded to. We implemented a proactive engagement strategy that involved responding to comments, engaging with relevant hashtags, and participating in conversations within Tony's niche by commenting on other creator's posts and sharing interesting content on stories. This helped foster a sense of community and authenticity.
